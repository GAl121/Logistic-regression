# Logistic-regression
machine learning

this project read to files as a csv.
the csv files transfaring hamming window and furier transform from 80 audio file 40 classical and 40 disco and save the data in this csv files.
there is 2 train datas witch call MFCC_Features_1 , MFCC_Features_2

at the first we work on train data 1 from file MFCC_Features_1 
the program read and scramble the data for two series train and test. 
from train seriese - the classifer train and learning the data using gradient descent, present graphs for picking alpha, w0 , and the number of steps in gradient descent to find the optimal veribles to get higher accurecy and lower cross entropy
show classifier accuracy and cross entropy using graph
show roc of two series
